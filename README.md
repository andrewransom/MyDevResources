## React
* Nick Raienko's [Awesome React List](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react)

### Tools & UI Components

* [React Dock](https://github.com/alexkuz/react-dock)
* [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
  * uses a proxy that creates proxies for your methods. Saving a file replaces the stored methods
  * Leverage's webpack feature called hot-mode replacement

## Redux
* Dan Abramov's [Tutorial Videos](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)
 * And the community notes


### Tools

* [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools)
 * based on react-dock, dock-monitor, and log-monitor
* [redux-form](http://erikras.github.io/redux-form)
 * a slick way to get forms going - not sure if it's good for more than the basics yet

* Use the Immutable Library ( https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/ )
